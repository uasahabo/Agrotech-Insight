      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Future of Sustainable Agriculture</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Sustainable agriculture is more than a buzzword—it's a commitment to farming that preserves resources, protects the environment, and ensures food security. It involves practices like crop rotation, organic fertilization, minimal pesticide use, and soil health management.
      </p>
      <p>
        With climate change affecting food production globally, it’s crucial to adopt smart irrigation systems, renewable energy for farming operations, and integrated pest management techniques. Governments and private sectors are also encouraging sustainable certification for farmers.
      </p>

        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Sustainable farming can increase biodiversity on farms by up to 30% compared to conventional farming.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Smart Farming: The Role of IoT in Agriculture</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Smart farming uses modern technologies like IoT (Internet of Things), AI, and machine learning to optimize agricultural practices. IoT sensors collect data on soil moisture, weather, temperature, and pest patterns in real-time, allowing farmers to make informed decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The integration of these tools helps reduce waste, boost productivity, and increase efficiency. Drone mapping, satellite imagery, and GPS-guided machinery are also revolutionizing how farms are managed.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-yellow-100 border-l-4 border-yellow-500">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Precision agriculture using smart tools can reduce fertilizer use by up to 40% while maintaining crop yield.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Soil Health: The Foundation of Productive Farming</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Healthy soil is essential for growing high-quality crops. Farmers are turning to regenerative agriculture which emphasizes cover cropping, composting, no-till practices, and natural pest control to restore degraded soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soil testing is also vital. It helps determine pH balance, nutrient deficiencies, and appropriate treatment methods. A good understanding of soil properties leads to better fertilization strategies and crop performance.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-yellow-100 border-l-4 border-yellow-500">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> It takes over 500 years for nature to create just 1 inch of topsoil—protect it wisely!

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Organic vs. Conventional Farming: What's the Difference?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Organic farming avoids synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, focusing instead on natural processes and eco-friendly inputs. It enhances biodiversity and promotes a balanced ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conventional farming, on the other hand, relies heavily on chemical inputs for rapid production. While it's often more cost-effective short-term, it may lead to long-term soil degradation and reduced resilience to pests.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-yellow-100 border-l-4 border-yellow-500">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Organic produce can have up to 50% more antioxidants than conventionally grown food.
